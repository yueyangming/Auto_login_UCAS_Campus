## Auto_login_UCAS_Campus

# What's this?

This is a small python project which can scan some leaked username and password pairs( Maybe from Meeting Center in YanQi Lake Campus), and try to login in with these accounts. I know a lot of my classmates and friends know this little 'secret', but none of them(including me) tried to use python to finish this process automatically, until now. 

### To be honest, this is super super fast. 

Before you start free surfing, just try to check if your python version is 3.x and packages requests is installed. 
It's brillent! if not, you can install it very easy using pip. 
pip install requests


# All right, How to use it?

Just run Auto_login.py 

It will give two kinds of feedback, if you are lucky, it will tell you :"Done, enjoy", this message mean that you are already Logged in, just open your brower to check it. 

Or it could be bad, when my script tell you "Sorry, i tried", this means it scaned all avaliable accounts, but can't find any... Seems you have to log in your own account. 


Ok, i think that's all i want to say.
